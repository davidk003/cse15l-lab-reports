# Lab report 5 - Going back
### *by David Kim*
## Context
As written on the coursepage on [Week 9](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week9/):

Go back and pick a favorite lab report or a lab activity you really liked or did not finish. Write a post going into detail on how you did the task, doing the task in a different way, or applying something you learned later to the same task.

I decided to choose and work on the string server, lab report 2, from [Week 3](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week3/).
I chose this specific assignment because I had no idea how websites worked internally before this, and doing this lab helped me to understand the basics of how a program running on a server might be accessed on a network/internet.

I am hoping to improve and add even further to the string server, as I found this to be the most fun lab report.

The goal of lab report 2 was the following:

Part 1: Write a StringServer so that strings added to it are recorded.

Part 2: Choose a bug from week 3's lab and provide:

* A failure-inducing input
* An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure
* The symptom
* The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it
