# Lab report 3 - Researching Commands
#### *by David Kim*

## Choosing command and options
The command I chose to research is the `grep` command.

The specific options I researched are the following:
`grep -f FILE,  --file=FILE`


`grep -v, --invert-match`

`grep -l, --files-with-matches`

`grep -r, --recursive`
